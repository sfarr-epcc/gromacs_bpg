Suggested workflow for GROMACS simulations
==========================================

This part of the GROMACS best practice guide walks you through a suggested
workflow for preparing, running, and analysing the results of your GROMACS
simulations. There are already many very good tutorials available to teach 
new users how to do this (see below).  
Here, we have collated and compiled the suggestions 
of these tutorials into what we believe to be the best way to prepare and run 
a GROMACS simulation.

This section is divided as follows: first we will describe how to choose and
prepare the input files for your system; we will then discuss the correct way to run your GROMACS 
simulations; and we will finish by discussing some of the post-analysis tools 
that are available.

Note that this section is written with the intent of helping users to use 
GROMACS. Some of the sections use examples of common shell-scripting 
practices -- it is assumed that the reader is either familiar with basic 
shell-scripting or knows where to learn more about this. Likewise, the 
background theory behind some of the techniques discussed in the post-analysis 
section is not presented here. Where possible, we have added links to places 
where this theory is explained.

--------------------
Preparing the system
--------------------

PDB2GMX
=======

The GROMACS ``pdb2gmx`` command is used to convert a coordinate file into a 
set of GROMACS topology files (in these examples, we will assume that the 
file is a ``.pdb`` file, but this is not a necessity). To run this:

.. code-block:: bash

    gmx pdb2gmx -f ${INPUT_FILE}.pdb

where ``${INPUT_FILE}.pdb`` is replaced with the input file name. You will be 
prompted to select the forcefield you would like to use. GROMACS comes with 
a number of AMBER and GROMOS forcefields, as well as a CHARMM and an OPLS-AA
option. You will also need to specify your water model (choices included are 
TIP models, and the SPC and SPC/E models). Specifying the water model here 
results in ``pdb2gmx`` to write a complete topology and will ensure that all
topology files are consistent if the system needs to be hydrated. The code above 
produces three outputs: a system topology ``topol.top``, a 
position restraint file ``posre.itp`` (included in the topology file), and a coordinate file ``conf.gro``. 
Further to these files, ``pdb2gmx`` will output a number of interesting 
details to screen, such as the total mass of the system given the coordinates 
and topology being used as well as the net charge of the system. The charge 
is particularly important to note down and will be used in the 
`Solvating a system`_ and `Adding ions and creating a charge-neutral system`_ 
steps of system preparation.

More information about the flags and options of this program can be found in 
the GROMACS 
`PDB2GMX manual <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-pdb2gmx.html>`_.

Generating your own forcefield file
-----------------------------------

.. note::

  It is advised to use one of the pre-existing GROMACS forcefields where 
  possible. Only consider generating your own forcefield if the ones 
  available on GROMACS do not fulfill your requirements.

GROMACS comes with a number of forcefields available out of the box. These 
forcefields are stored within the main GROMACS directory in 
``share/gromacs/top``. If the forcefield you want to use is not present, you
will need to generate your own forcefield files. To do this, create a 
directory ``<forcefield>.ff`` in your working directory, with ``<forcefield>``
replaced by a sensible name. Within this directory, create a 
``forcefield.doc`` file and write a simple one-sentence description of your 
forcefield -- this description is what will come up in ``pdb2gmx`` when you 
choose a forcefield. Next, generate a ``forcefield.itp`` included topology 
file. This file is a topology file where you can define the parameters for 
atoms, bond, angles, dihedrals, *etc.*. You can find more information about 
generating topology files from scratch in the GROMACS manual 
`file format page <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/reference-manual/file-formats.html#top>`_.

Using a ``<forcefield>.ff`` directory has a number of advantages over writing 
out your system topologies directly. For one, this allows for better 
reproducibility in the even that you want to simulate a new system with this 
forcefield. It also has a number of functionalities that can be useful. For 
instance, adding a ``watermodels.dat`` file into the forcefield directory 
makes it easy to keep track of water models available. A line and description
can be added in this file for each water-model included topology file. This 
file is what prompts the choice of water model in ``pdb2gmx``.

Once it is populated, running ``pdb2gmx`` in the directory containing your 
``<forcefield>.ff`` directory will result in your new forcefield being included 
at the top of the list of selectable forcefields. If you are happy with your 
``<forcefield>.ff`` directory and you will use it a lot (and if you have the 
correct permissions to edit parts of the GROMACS directory), you can copy it to 
the ``share/gromacs/top`` of the GROMACS directory (or to ``$GMXLIB`` which 
should be the same directory). In doing so, your forcefield will become a 
permanent part of the forcefields that ``pdb2gmx`` can use.

.. note::

  You can also generate an Amber or CHARMM topology by using the   AmberTool 
  ``antechamber`` function or the CHARMM ``cgenff`` function. To do this, you 
  should follow the procedures described above, making sure to select an 
  appropriate forcefield from the selection GROMACS provides. Then, use a 
  parameter-generating tool like ``antechamber`` with ``actype`` (for Amber) 
  or ``cgenff`` (for CHARMM). The topologies generated in this way can then be 
  added to the GROMACS topology that you generated. This can be done by 
  opening the GROMACS topology file and including the following line at the start:
  
  .. code-block:: bash
  
    #include "/path/to/forcefield_file.itp"
    
  where the path is to the topology file generated in ``antechamber`` or 
  ``cgenff``.

For more information on generating your own forcefield, please see the GROMACS
manual pages about 
`adding a residue <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/how-to/topology.html>`_
and `force field organisations <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/reference-manual/topologies/force-field-organization.html>`_.

-------------------------------------------
Preparing and solvating your simulation box
-------------------------------------------

Generating a system of replicates from a GROMACS structure file
================================================================

It is possible to populate a simulation box with molecules by replicating the contents 
of a GROMACS structure file (``.gro``) multiple times. This can be achieved 
with the ``insert-molecules`` command. While any structure file can be used 
(including crowded system file), this is particularly useful if you want to 
create a system with a large number of copies of a single molecule (*i.e.* 
as found in a lipid bilayer or a non-aqueous solvent). Furthermore, the 
topology (``.top``) file generated for the system to be replicated will still 
work for the new, larger system, by including the total number of molecules in the directive [molecules].

To generate a system using this command, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx insert-molecules -ci ${INPUT}.gro -o ${OUTPUT}.gro \
                       -nmol ${N} -box ${X_LENGTH} ${Y_LENGTH} ${Z_LENGTH}
                       
where ``${INPUT}.gro`` is the structure file of the molecule/system you wish 
to replicate, ``${OUTPUT}.gro`` is the output file, ``${N}`` is the number of 
times that the contents of ``${INPUT}.gro`` will be replicated, and 
``${X_LENGTH}``, ``${Y_LENGTH}``, and ``${Z_LENGTH}`` are the dimensions of 
the cubic box into which these ``${N}`` replicas must be packed.

There are number of further options to help pack your system, including a way 
of defining the default van der Waals distance between atoms in your system, a 
way of inserting new molecules into an existing system, and methods to control 
the amount of random rotation that replicated molecules can undergo. All of 
these options can be found in the 
`gmx insert-molecules <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-insert-molecules.html>`_ page of the GROMACS manual.

Generating a simulation box
===========================

Now that a topology has been generated, the next step is to generate a 
simulation box into which to place this topology. For this, use the 
``editconf`` command. This tool has a number of functionalities, including 
generating and orienting a simulation box, and filing it with pre-generated 
topologies. To create a simulation box with ``editconf``, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx editconf -f ${INPUT}.gro -center -d ${SEPARATION} -bt ${BOX_TYPE} \
               -o ${OUTPUT}.gro
  
where ``${INPUT}.gro`` is the input forcefield-compliant coordinate file, 
``${OUTPUT}.gro`` is the chosen output name (the default is ``out.gro``), 
the ``-c`` flag will place the system described in ``${INPUT}.gro`` into the 
centre of the simulation box, ``-d ${SEPARATION}`` defines the minimum 
separation between the input and the edge of the box (units are in nm), and 
``-bt ${BOX_TYPE}`` defines the type of box for the simulation (triclinic is 
the default, but other options are cubic, octohedral, or dodecahedral). There 
are a number of other ``editconf`` options, predominantly to have more 
control over defining the simulation box. These can be found in the GROMACS 
manual 
`gmx editconf page <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-editconf.html>`_.

Solvating a system
==================

The aptly-named ``solvate`` tool can be used to create a box of solvent or 
to solvate a pre-existing box. To use it, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx solvate -cp ${SOLUTE}.gro -cs ${SOLVENT}.gro -p ${TOPOLOGY}.top \
              -o ${OUTPUT}.gro
  
where ``${SOLUTE}.gro`` is the simulation box configured using the steps 
described above, ``${SOLVENT}.gro`` is the solvent configuration file (note 
that GROMACS has a number of pre-defined solvent configuration files but that 
you can also prepare and use your own), and ``${TOPOLOGY}.top`` is the 
topology obtained when running `PDB2GMX`_. If using a GROMACS-provided 
solvent, the addition of this solvent should not alter the net charge of the 
system.

For further information, please see the GROMACS manual 
`gmx solvate <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-solvate.html>`_

Adding ions and creating a charge-neutral system
================================================

Adding ions to your solvated system can serve two purposes: it can help to 
neutralise any charge in your system; and it allows you to simulate systems 
with similar salt concentrations to their real-world equivalents. Adding 
ions is done in two parts: first, you need to use the ``grompp`` tool to 
generate a ``.tpr`` file to be used when adding ions, and then you must 
replace some of the recently-added solvent molecules with the necessary 
counterions using ``genion``.

The GROMACS preprocessor tool ``grompp`` reads in coordinate and topology 
files to generate an atomic-level input file (with a ``.tpr`` extension). 
This ``.tpr`` file contains all of the parameters needed for all atoms in 
the system. We will go into more details about the ``grompp`` tool in the 
`Running a simulation`_ section. For now, the important part is that, to 
generate a run input ``.tpr`` file, ``grompp`` needs a structure (``.gro``) 
file, a topology (``.top``) file, and a file defining the instructions for 
the simulation run (this is kept in an ``.mdp`` file). This ``.mdp`` file can 
be kept empty when ionising the system as no actual simulation is to be run. 
To generate the ``,tpr`` file, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx grompp -f ${RUN_FILE}.mdp -c ${COORDINATES}.gro -p ${TOPOLOGY}.top \
             -o ${OUTPUT}.tpr
  
It is likely that ``grompp`` will output a number of notes to screen (one of 
which should be reminding you of the net non-zero charge of your system). In 
this case, these can be ignored (this is an exception and is not usually true).

Now that the ``.tpr`` has been generated, ``genion`` can be used to make the 
charge of the system neutral. The system charge is decreased by replacing a 
number of parts of the system with anions and cations. This is done by 
running the following (note that the ``${INPUT}.tpr`` named below is likely 
to be the ``${OUTPUT.tpr}`` generated in the ``grompp`` step above): 

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx genion -s {INPUT}.tpr -p ${TOPOLOGY}.top -neutral -o ${OUTPUT}.gro
             
You will be prompted to choose the group within your system (solvents, 
solutes, protein backbones, *etc.*) that you would like ions to replace, with 
the frequency of occurrence of each group also shown. Note that some groups 
may have overlap completely and be different names for the same group. In 
general, it is best to replace solvent molecules with ions (the group named 
``SOL``). Once a group is chosen, ``genion`` will replace a number of that 
group with anions and cations until the system is charge neutral. The default 
anion name is ``CL``, though this name can be changed with the ``-nname`` 
flag, and the default cation name is ``NA`, but this name can be changed with 
the ``nname`` flag. By default, the cation and anion charges are 1 and -1 
respectively, but this can be changed with the ``-pq`` flag for the cation and 
the ``-nq`` flag for the anion.

For further information, please see the GROMACS manual  
`gmx grompp <http://manual.gromacs.org/current/onlinehelp/gmx-grompp.html>`_, 
and `gmx genion <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-genion.html>`_ 
pages.

--------------------
Running a simulation
--------------------

This section describes how to set the GROMACS simulation parameters, how to 
generate a run input file from a GROMACS topology and parameter file, how to 
run a simulation in GROMACS, and how to analyse the results produced. It is 
assumed that you already have a system topology ready to use (by following 
the steps in the `Preparing the system`_ section) -- if this is not the case, 
and if you are unsure how to create this topology, please read through that 
section.

Creating a run parameter file
=============================


A GROMACS molecular dynamics parameter (``.mdp``) file defines the simulation 
parameters to be used during a simulation. A number of options can be set in 
this script, including: defining the simulation integrator that will define 
the method used to solve Newton's equations to propagate the system forward in 
time; setting the size of the simulation timestep and total simulation time; 
setting the restrictions within which the system will be simulated (such as 
setting a system pressure/temperature through a thermostat or barostat); 
setting or adjusting the way the simulation forcefield is interpreted (by 
*e.g.* defining the way short- and long-ranged interactions are calculated 
and at what distance they are truncated); to define which simulation 
properties to output (and the output frequency); and many more options. Given 
the number of options and variables that can be included, not included, or 
kept as default, we will not go over all of the options here and will instead 
look at and explain an example molecular dynamics parameter file. You can find 
a list of all available options in the GROMACS manual
`molecular dynamics parameters page <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/user-guide/mdp-options.html>`_.

Example molecular dynamics parameter file
-----------------------------------------

.. note::

  GROMACS has been developed to be forcefield agnostic. This means that a 
  large number of different forcefields can be run using GROMACS. However, 
  this also means that different forcefields will require slightly different 
  constraints to be defined in their ".mdp" parameter files. You can find 
  more about this in the 
  `Force fields in GROMACS <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/user-guide/force-fields.html>`_
  section of the GROMACS manual.
  

The GROMACS manual has the following 
`example script <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/user-guide/file-formats.html#mdp>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

  ; Intergrator, timestep, and total run time
  integrator               = md
  dt                       = 0.002
  nsteps                   = 500000
  
  ; Logs and outputs
  nstlog                   = 5000
  nstenergy                = 5000
  
  ; Bond constraints
  constraints              = all-bonds
  constraint-algorithm     = lincs
  
  ; Van der Waals interactions
  vdwtype                  = Cut-off
  rvdw                     = 1.0
  cutoff-scheme            = Verlet
  DispCorr                 = EnerPres
  
  ; Coulombic interactions
  coulombtype              = PME
  rcoulomb                 = 1.0
  
  ; Thermostat
  tcoupl                   = V-rescale
  tc-grps                  = Protein  SOL
  ref-t                    = 300      300
  
  ; Barostat
  pcoupl                   = Parrinello-Rahman
  ref-p                    = 1.0
  tau-p                    = 2.0
  compressibility          = 4.5e-5

.. note::

    The parameters chosen for time step, bond constraints and van der Waals/electrostatic 
    interactions depend on the force field being used. 
   

First note that, while the the example above is ordered in a sensible way, 
with commands grouped by what they are defining (*e.g.* temperature, pressure, 
van der Waals interactions, *etc.*), the order in which the individual 
commands are written does not matter. Having said that, we would recommend 
grouping commands affecting similar simulation aspects together to help 
future readability. Also, if the same command appears twice in a 
``.mdp`` file, the second appearance will override the first.

The first block of the example script defines the molecular dynamics 
integrator as a Verlet leap-frog algorithm (``integrator = md``), declares 
that the simulation timestep will be 2 fs (``dt = 0.002``, where the default 
unit is ps), and that the simulation will run for a total of 500,000 *dt*
timesteps (``nstep = 500000``) or 1 ns.

The next block defines the simulation outputs. ``nstlog`` sets the time 
interval between each output to log (``md.log``) of the energy components and 
physical properties of the system at 5,000 *dt*. ``nstenergy`` sets the time 
interval between each output to the energy file (``ener.edr``) of the energy 
components of the system at 5,000 *dt* -- note that this file is written in 
binary.

In this example, all bonds are constrained and set to be rigid. This is done 
with the ``constraints = all-bonds`` command. Furthermore, the constraint 
algorithm is set to be the linear constraint solver algorithm with the 
``constraint-algortihm = LINCS`` command.

The van der Waals interactions are set as truncated (``vdwtype = cutoff``), 
with a cutoff distance of 1 nm (``rvdw = 1.0``). This means that no van der 
Waals interactions will be computed for pairs of particles whose 
centre-of-mass separation greater than 1 nm. To save in simulation time, a 
neighbour-list cutoff scheme is used. The ``cutoff-scheme = Verlet`` command 
specifies how this list is generated. A long-ranged dispersion correction to 
the energy and pressure is considered here with the ``DispCorr = EnerPress`` 
command. The Coulombic interactions will be calculated using the smooth 
particle-mesh Ewald (SPME) method (``coulombtype = PME``), with an interaction 
cutoff of 1 nm (``rcoulomb = 1.0``). 

The thermostat used for this simulation is defined by the 
``tcoupl = v-rescale`` -- in this case, the velocity rescaling algorithm is 
used. The ``tc-grps`` is there to specify that the protein and solvent 
(``SOL``) should have separate heat baths for this simulations. The reference 
temperature (or desired temperature) is set by ``ref-t``. In this case, the 
reference temperature for both the protein and the solvent have been set to 
300 K. Note that the reference temperature must be set for every group defined 
in ``tc-grps`` and that these temperatures do not need to be the same.

In this example script, the barostat is defined with the ``pcoul`` parameter 
as the Parinello-Rahman barostat. The reference (or desired) pressure is set 
at 1 atm with the ``ref-p`` command, and the coupling time constant ``tau-p`` 
is set to 2 ps. Much like the temperature coupling time constant set for the 
thermostat, the pressure coupling time constant is used to dictate the 
frequency and amplitude of fluctuations during a simulation. Finally, the 
``compressibility`` parameter is used to define the compressibility of the 
system (how the volume of the system changes as pressure is changed). In this 
case, it is set as 4.5e-5 bar^-1 (water compressibility).

Generating your simulation input file
-------------------------------------

Once you have prepared your ``.mdp`` file, you are ready to combine it with 
the topology you've prepared to create a run input ``.tpr`` file. For this, we 
will use the GROMACS pre-processing tool ``grompp``. This is very similar to 
the step described in the `Adding ions and creating a charge-neutral system`_ 
section, but with more care regarding the warnings that are output. Like 
before, this is done by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx grompp -f ${RUN_FILE}.mdp -c ${COORDINATES}.gro -p ${TOPOLOGY}.top \
             -o ${OUTPUT}.tpr
             
where ``${RUN_FILE}.mdp`` is file discussed in 
`Creating a run parameter file`_, and ``${COORDINATES}.gro`` and 
``${TOPOLOGY}.top`` were generated following the instructions in the 
`Preparing the system`_ section. The ``${OUTPUT}.tpr`` file generated here 
is the only file needed to proceed with running a GROMACS molecular dynamics 
simulation.

Running your simulation
-----------------------

With the run input ``.tpr`` file now generated, we are ready to run a GROMACS 
simulation. For this, we will use the ``mdrun`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx mdrun -s ${INPUT}.tpr
  
This command will run the simulation with the topology that you've prepared 
and the molecular dynamics parameters that you've chosen.

Once the simulation is complete, ``mdrun`` will have produced a number of 
files. The ``ener.edr`` file is a semi-binary file that contains all of the 
thermodynamic information output during the run (*e.g.* energy breakdowns, 
instantaneous presssure and temperature, system denstity, *etc.*). Likewise, 
the ``md.log`` file generated outputs these properties, but in a text format. 
The ``traj.trr`` file is a binary that contains details of the simulation 
trajectory and ``xtc`` file is a compressed and portable format for trajectories.
The final file produced by default is the ``counfout.gro`` is a 
text file containing the particle coordinates and velocities for the final 
step of the simulation.

It is possible to add flags to ``mdrun`` to alter some of the parameters that 
had been set in the molecular dynamics parameter file. For instance, the 
``-nsteps`` flag can be used to override the number of timesteps that the 
simulation should run for. Also, there are a number of useful options for 
defining input files (and input file types), output files, and parameters 
related to the computational system on which you are running (such as the 
``-nt`` option to set the number of MPI threads that the simulation should 
use). More information on these and other options can be found on the GROMACS 
`gmx mdrun <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-mdrun.html>`_
page.

----------------------------------
Post-processing and analysis tools
----------------------------------

With the simulation complete, we can analyse the simulation trajectory and 
understand what the simulation has demonstrated. GROMACS offers a number of 
post-simulation analysis tools. In this section, we will discuss tools that 
can be used to: generate the thermodynamic properties of interest; obtain 
radial distribution functions and correlation functions; 

Thermodynamic properties of the system
======================================

The GROMACS ``energy`` tool can be used to extract energy components from an 
energy (``.edr``) file. By default, this tool will generate an XMGrace file. 
To use this, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx energy -f ${INPUT_ENERGY_FILE}.edr -o ${OUTPUT_XMGRACE_FILE}.xvg
  
When running this, you will get a prompt asking which property you would like 
output (*e.g.* potential energy, kinetic energy, pressure, temperature, 
*etc.*). Enter the correct number to generate an XMGrace file that, when 
plotted, will show you how that property varied over the simulation run. 
There are a number of other options for the ``energy`` command, and these 
can be found in the GROMACS manual 
`gmx energy <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-energy.html#gmx-.. energy>`_
page.

Generating an index file
========================

GROMACS has a post-analysis tool for generating radial distribution functions 
(RDFs). Before generating an RDF, we will need to create a GROMACS index 
(``.ndx``) file to categorise the various parts that compose the simulation 
into indexed groups. This can be done with the ``gmx make_ndx`` command. To 
use it, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx make_ndx -f ${INPUT}.gro -o ${OUTPUT}.ndx
  
where ``${INPUT}.gro`` is a GROMACS configuration file for the trajectory you 
are wanting to calculate the RDF for. Provided you used the default names in 
your ``mdrun``, you can simply use ``confout.gro``. The ``make_ndx`` command 
will analyse the system, and output the default index groups. It is possible 
to create new index groups by using the command prompts listed (for instance, 
you can create a group composed of only the oxygens from the solvent waters by 
running ``a OW`` within ``make_ndx``). For more information, please see the
GROMACS manual
`gmx make_ndx <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-make_ndx.html>`_ 
page.


For more complex manipulations than selecting all of one group of atoms, 
GROMACS provides the ``gmx select`` option. This will allow you to define 
the exact time or particles or regions of interest within your simulation. 
You can find more information on how to use this in the GROMACS manual
`Groups and Selections <https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2019/reference-manual/analysis/using-groups.html#selections>`_
page.


Radial distribution function
============================

Once an appropriate index file is generated, with the atoms for which an RDF 
is to be calculated indexed into appropriate groups, we can use the 
``gmx rdf`` command to generate the RDFs. This is done by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx rdf -f ${TRAJECTORY_INPUT}.trr -n ${INDEX_INPUT}.ndx  \
          -ref ${REFERENCE_GROUP} -sel ${SELECTED_GROUP} -bin ${BIN_WIDTH}
          -o ${OUTPUT}.xvg
  
where ``${TRAJECTORY_INPUT}.trr`` is the trajectory file for which you would 
like to generate an RDF, and ``${INDEX_INPUT}.ndx`` is the index file that you 
produced using ``make_ndx``. ``${REFERENCE_GROUP}`` should be replaced with 
the name of the principal group to be used in the RDF as it appears in the 
``${INDEX_INPUT}.ndx`` file. Likewise, ``${SELECTED_GROUP}`` should be 
replaced with the name of the atom group(s) for which you want to calculate 
the RDF against the position of the reference group (*e.g.* if you want to 
calculate the RDF between sodium ions and chloride ions, your reference 
group would be one of ``NA`` or ``CL``, and your selected group would be the 
one not chosen as reference). Note that it is possible for your reference and 
selected groups to be the same group.

Mean squared displacement and velocity autocorrelation functions
================================================================

Gromacs offers a number of tools to calculate correlation and autocorrelation 
functions. Here, we will look at two specific example: the mean-squared 
displacement (MSD) and velocity autocorrelation function (VACF). We will focus 
on how to generate these functions within GROMACS but you can use these links 
to find an overview of the theory behind the 
`MSD <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/reference-manual/analysis/mean-square-displacement.html>`_
and the 
`VACF <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2019/reference-manual/analysis/correlation-function.html>`_.

Calculating the MSD of parts of a system can be done using the ``gmx msd``. 
This can be run using:

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx msd -f ${INPUT_TRAJECTORY}.trr -s ${INPUT_TOPOLOGY}.tpr -o ${OUTPUT}.xvg
  
where ``${INPUT_TRAJECTORY}.trr`` is the trajectory file of the simulation for 
which the MSD is being calculated, and ``${INPUT_TOPOLOGY}.tpr`` can be the 
input file used to obtain this trajectory (note that it is possible to use 
the final topology ``confout.gro`` file here instead to obtain the same 
results). Running this command will prompt you to choose the group for which 
you would like the MSD. Note that, if the group you are looking for is not 
present in the list, you can generate an index file (see 
`Generating an index file`_) where you can define this new group. To include 
this index file, add the option ``-n ${INDEX_FILE}.ndx`` to the command above.
For more information and options, please look at the GROMACS manual page on 
the `gmx msd command <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-msd.html#gmx-msd>`_.

VACFs can be generated using the ``gmx velacc`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx velacc -f ${INPUT_TRAJECTORY}.trr -o ${OUTPUT}.xvg
  
where ``${INPUT_TRAJECTORY}.trr`` is the trajectory file of the simulation 
for which the VACF is being produced. You will get a prompt asking for which 
group of atoms the VACF should be calculated. If the group you want is not 
present, you may need to create it by following the instructions in the 
`Generating an index file`_ section of the manual. To include your index file, 
add it with the ``-n ${INPUT_INDEX}.ndx`` option. You can find more options 
and information on the GROMACS manual 
`gmx velacc <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-velacc.html#gmx-velacc>`_ page.


Calculating distances
=====================
Interparticle distances, that is the distance between two particles in a simulation
trajectory, can be calculated using the `gmx distance <https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-distance.html>`_ comand

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx distance -f ${INPUT_TRAJECTORY}.trr -select <selection> -oall ${OUTPUT}.xvg

Where ``${INPUT_TRAJECTORY}.trr`` is the trajectory file of the simulation for 
which the distances are being calculated. ``<selection>`` is where you specify 
a list of pairs of particles to calculate the distance between. More information 
on selections can be found in the gromacs manual `selections <https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/selections.html>`_ page.
As an example to calculate the distance between the i-th and j-th atom you could use the selection:

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx distance -f ${INPUT_TRAJECTORY}.trr -select "atomnr i j" -oall ${OUTPUT}.xvg

Where ``i`` and ``j`` are the atom numbers. ``${OUTPUT}.xvg`` will contain a timeseries 
of the distance between pair ``i`` and ``j``.

More than one pair of atoms can be specified, e.g 

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx distance -f ${INPUT_TRAJECTORY}.trr -select "atomnr i j k l" -oall ${OUTPUT}.xvg

``${OUTPUT}.xvg`` will contain a timeseries of the distance between atoms ``i`` and ``j``, and 
the distance between atoms ``k`` and ``l``. The options ``-oav`` and ``-oh`` can be used to produce 
a timeseries of the average distance for all selected pairs or a histogram respectively.


A similar tool is `gmx mindist <https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-mindist.html>`_ which computes
the minimum distance between two groups.

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx mindist -f ${INPUT_TRAJECTORY}.trr  -n ${INDEX_INPUT}.ndx  -od ${OUTPUT}.vxg

Where ``${INPUT_TRAJECTORY}.trr`` is the trajectory file of the simulation for 
which the distances are being calculated and ``${INDEX_INPUT}.ndx`` is the index file that you 
produced using ``make_ndx``. You will get a prompt asking for which group you would like to select. You will need to
select two groups. It will then print out a timeseries of the minimum distance between the two groups to the specified output file.

Additional commonly used options are the ``-max`` flag which compute the maxiumum distance instead of the minimum. And the ``-pi`` option
which calulate the minimum distance of a group to its peridic image. For this you only specify one group in the prompt and you will need to provide
the topology file ``-s ${INPUT_TOPOLOGY}.tpr``.

The third distance tool is `gmx pairdist <https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-pairdist.html>`_ which calculates pairwise
distance between one reference slection and one or more other selections.

.. code-block:: bash

  gmx pairdist -f ${INPUT_TRAJECTORY}.trr -ref <reference selection> -sel <other selection> -o ${OUTPUT}.xvg

Where ``${INPUT_TRAJECTORY}.trr`` is the trajectory file of the simulation for 
which the distances are being calculated, `<refernece selection>` are the reference positions to calculate distances from, and `<other selection>` are 
the positions to calculate distances for. More information 
on selections can be found in the gromacs manual `selections <https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/selections.html>`_ page.
An example the following command will compute the minimum distance at each timestep between the carbon atoms and the nitrogen atoms.

.. code-block:: bash

    gmx pairdist -f ${INPUT_TRAJECTORY}.trr -ref "atomname C" -sel "atomname N"

By default the result is grouped over all atoms in the selection so one number (the minimum distance between the groups) is returned for each timestep in the trajectory. Additional options to the command can give the full list of pairwise distances, see `gmx pairdist <https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/onlinehelp/gmx-pairdist.html>`_ .
